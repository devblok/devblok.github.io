Hello and welcome to my blog! I'm a DevOps Engineer in Europe somewhere, starting this blog to post any intersting findings in tech.
That is, of course, I remember to write this blog, because it's not really a habit.

Interesting projects and findings come across me all the time, so I hope I can share them here.

It's likely that I will be posting a lot of Go things here, since that's what I do when not DevOpsing. But there should be more than just that.
